>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how consumers and companies alike access and manage their finances. With the aggregate potential cost savings for banks from AI applications estimated at $447 billion by 2023, banks are finding new ways to incorporate the tech into their services1.

>AI in finance encompasses everything from chatbot assistants to fraud detection and task automation. Most banks (80%) are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI1. Banks using AI can streamline tedious processes and vastly improve the customer experience by offering 24/7 access to their accounts and financial advice services1.

>One of the most significant business cases for AI in finance is its ability to prevent fraud and cyberattacks. Consumers look for banks and other financial services that provide secure accounts, especially with online payment fraud losses expected to jump to $48 billion per year by 20231.

>AI has the ability to analyze and single-out irregularities in patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed by humans. One bank taking advantage of AI in consumer finance is JPMorgan Chase. For Chase, consumer banking represents over 50% of its net income; as such, the bank has adopted key fraud detecting applications for its account holders1.
